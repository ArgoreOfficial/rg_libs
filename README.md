various libraries for RetroGadgets + LÖVE2D Compatibility Layer 

note: bit of a mess right now as I've been using this repo for a project lol  
I'll clean it up later, trust

## LÖVE2D Layer
Fairly barebones right now but I'll keep working on it  

To use with your own, copy `main.lua` and the `RetroGadgets/` folder from this repository, along with your `CPU0.lua` script  
Your folder should look like so:  
```
- RetroGadgets/
- Import/CPU0.lua
- main.lua
```
At the top of `main.lua` there is a table containing config for the gadget
